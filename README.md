# News-Feed
Made a simple news feed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript by using external APIs to fetch the news.
The project is a dynamic and responsive website that fetches news articles in real time using an external API.
It containns a Navigation bar to filter news topics according to the user preferences with a dropdown called More for other different relevant topics integrated with outside clicks handling.
Added a feature to switch themes according to the user's preferences.
